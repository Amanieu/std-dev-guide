# Public API design

**Status:** Stub

Standard library APIs typically follow the [API Guidelines], which were originally spawned from the standard library itself.

[API Guidelines]: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/

## For reviewers

For new unstable features, look for any prior discussion of the proposed API to see what options and tradeoffs have already been considered. If in doubt, ping `@rust-lang/libs` for input.
